## Getting started

Rustypot is yet another communication library for robotis Dynamixel motors. It is currently used in the [Reachy project](https://www.pollen-robotics.com/reachy/).

## Feature Overview

* Relies on [serialport](https://docs.rs/serialport/latest/serialport/) for serial communication
* Support for dynamixel protocol v1 and v2 (can also use both on the same bus)
* Support for sync read and sync write operations
* Easy support for new type of motors (register definition through macros)
* Pure Rust

### Examples
```rust
use rustypot::{device::mx, DynamixelSerialIO};
use std::time::Duration;

fn main() {
    let mut serial_port = serialport::new("/dev/ttyACM0", 1_000_000)
        .timeout(Duration::from_millis(10))
        .open()
        .expect("Failed to open port");

    let io = DynamixelSerialIO::v1();

    loop {
        let pos =
            mx::read_present_position(&io, serial_port.as_mut(), 11).expect("Communication error");
        println!("Motor 11 present position: {:?}", pos);
    }
}
```
