## Getting started

Rustypot is a communication library for Dynamixel/Feetech motors. It is notably used in the [Reachy project](https://www.pollen-robotics.com/reachy/). More types of servo can be added in the future.

## Feature Overview

* Relies on [serialport](https://docs.rs/serialport/latest/serialport/) for serial communication
* Support for dynamixel protocol v1 and v2 (can also use both on the same bus)
* Support for sync read and sync write operations
* Easy support for new type of motors (register definition through macros). Currently support for dynamixel XL320, XL330, XL430, XM430, MX*, Orbita 2D & 3D.
* Pure Rust plus python bindings (using [pyo3](https://pyo3.rs/)).

To add new servo, please refer to the [Servo documentation](./servo/README.md).

## APIs

It exposes two APIs:
* `DynamixelProtocolHandler`: low-level API. It handles the serial communication and the Dynamixel protocol parsing. It can be used for fine-grained control of the shared bus with other communication.
* `Controller`: high-level API for the Dynamixel protocol. Simpler and cleaner API but it takes full ownership of the io (it can still be shared if wrapped with a mutex for instance).

See the examples below for usage.

### Examples
```rust
use rustypot::{DynamixelProtocolHandler, servo::dynamixel::mx};
use std::time::Duration;

fn main() {
    let mut serial_port = serialport::new("/dev/ttyACM0", 1_000_000)
        .timeout(Duration::from_millis(10))
        .open()
        .expect("Failed to open port");

    let dph = DynamixelProtocolHandler::v1();

    loop {
        let pos =
            mx::read_present_position(&dph, serial_port.as_mut(), 11).expect("Communication error");
        println!("Motor 11 present position: {:?}", pos);
    }
}
```

```rust
use rustypot::servo::feetech::sts3215::STS3215Controller;
use std::time::Duration;

fn main() {
    let serial_port = serialport::new("/dev/ttyUSB0", 1_000_000)
        .timeout(Duration::from_millis(1000))
        .open()
        .unwrap();

    let mut c = STS3215Controller::new()
            .with_protocol_v1()
            .with_serial_port(serial_port);

    let pos = c.sync_read_present_position(&vec![1, 2]).unwrap();
    println!("Motors present position: {:?}", pos);

    c.sync_write_goal_position(&vec![1, 2], &vec![1000, 2000]).unwrap();
}
```

## Tools

Simple bus scanning tool:

```bash
cargo run --bin=scan -- --serialport=/dev/ttyUSB0 --baudrate=1000000 --protocol=v1
```

## Documentation

See https://docs.rs/rustypot for more information on APIs and examples.

See [python/README.md](./python/README.md) for information on how to use the python bindings.

## Python bindings

The python bindings are generated using [pyo3](https://pyo3.rs/). They are available on `pypi`(https://pypi.org/project/rustypot/). You can install them using pip.

```bash
pip install rustypot
```

To build them locally, you can use [maturin](https://www.maturin.rs).

First, generate the type annotations for the python bindings, by running:

```bash
cargo run --release --bin stub_gen --features python
```

Then, you can build the python bindings using maturin. You can either build the wheel files to distribute them, or install them directly in your local python environment.

To build the wheel files, you can run:

```bash
maturin build --release --features python --features pyo3/extension-module
```

or, if you want to install them in your local python environment:

```bash
maturin develop --release --features python --features pyo3/extension-module
```

See [maturin official documentation](https://maturin.rs) for more information on how to use it.

### Using the Python bindings

The Python bindings exposes the same API as the Controller API in the rust crate.

You first need to create a Controller object. For instance, to communicate with a serial port to Feetech STS3215 motors, you can do the following:

```python
from rustypot import Sts3215PyController

c = Sts3215PyController(serial_port='/dev/ttyUSB0', baudrate=100000, timeout=0.1)
```


Then, you can directly read/write any register of the motor. For instance, to read the present position of the motor with id 1, you can do:

```python

pos = c.read_present_position(1)
print(pos)
```

You can also write to the motors. For instance, to set the goal position of the motors with id 1 to 90° you can do:

```python
import numpy as np
c.write_goal_position(1, np.deg2rad(90.0))
```


Then, you can also sync_read any registers on multiple motors in a single operations. For instance, to read the present position of the motors with id 1 and 2, you can do:

```python

pos = c.sync_read_present_position([1, 2])
print(pos)
```

Same with sync_write. For instance, to set the goal position of the motors with id 1 and 2 to 0.0 and 90° respectively, you can do:

```python
import numpy as np
c.sync_write_goal_position([1, 2], [0.0, np.deg2rad(90.0)])
```
